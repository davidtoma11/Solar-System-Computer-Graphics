# Solar System
This project is a 3D simulation of a simplified solar system, implementing computer graphics techniques such as geometric transformations, lighting, shading, and texture mapping. The scene includes the Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, the Moon, and Mars, each modeled with realistic positioning, scaling, and coloring.

# The rendering pipeline includes:
- Object Placement & Scaling: Each celestial body is positioned using translation matrices (glm::translate) and scaled using (glm::scale) to reflect real-world proportions.
- Lighting & Shadows: A point light source at the Sun's position simulates illumination, while shading techniques implement ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting effects. Shadows are generated by projecting objects relative to the light source.
- Geometric Transformations: Each planet follows orbital positioning and rotation, with transformations applied dynamically.
- Rendering Functions: DrawPlanet and DrawShadow manage object drawing and shadow projection, while shaders handle color blending and realistic light interactions.
- Texture Mapping: The Sun is textured using a 2D image (GL_TEXTURE_2D) to enhance visual realism.
  
This simulation effectively demonstrates real-time rendering concepts, creating an interactive and visually accurate representation of planetary motion and lighting in a 3D environment.
