# Solar System
This project is a 3D simulation of the solar system, focusing on realistic rendering through lighting, shadows, and transformations. It features planets and the Moon, each with accurate positioning, scaling, and colors. The system includes dynamic lighting with shadows, object rotation, and texture mapping for added realism. Functions like DrawPlanet and DrawShadow handle rendering, while shading techniques simulate ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting effects.
